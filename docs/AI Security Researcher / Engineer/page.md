The Ethereum Foundation

The Ethereum Foundation (EF) is a global non-profit organization dedicated to supporting Ethereum. Our mission is to ensure the long-term success of Ethereum by allocating resources to critical projects, being a positive voice within the Ethereum ecosystem, and advocating for Ethereum to the outside world.

The EF Protocol Security Research Team

The EF is seeking highly motivated and collaborative security researchers / engineers who with their skillset can help secure the Ethereum protocol, which enables users and projects to utilize Ethereum. To thrive in this role, you will need to be very self-motivated and be comfortable working asynchronously. Our organization is very flat, and we believe that success comes from being able to work on what you find interesting and valuable rather than strict top-down directives. Within the team, we are developing AI tools such as PR security reviewers, tools to help review how clients implement specifications, and more.

About you

Your values align with the Ethereum ecosystem. Even if you are new to the space, you are interested in open source collaboration and decentralized systems. You understand the value of open source, decentralization, privacy, and you are especially interested in security.

You are highly motivated and naturally curious when it comes to exploring new ideas. You are thorough in your work and pay attention to the small details.

You are skilled at communicating on a remote, global team. We are a diverse team of collaborators from many different countries. You are comfortable exploring both synchronistic and a-synchronistic methods of communication.

You are resourceful. The projects that need to be secured are exploring new technology. You possess patience in ambiguity, ask questions, and seek clarity by drawing connections to indirect products and concepts.

You work well both independently and with others. No matter who you are working with, you are curious about their needs and goals within the scope of the project. You welcome feedback and take the time to understand the perspectives of your teammates.

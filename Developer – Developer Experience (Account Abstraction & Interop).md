Developer – Developer Experience (Account Abstraction & Interop)
Remote, Boulder, BerlinEthereum Foundation – Protocol /Remote

About the Ethereum Foundation
The Ethereum Foundation (EF) is a global non-profit organization dedicated to helping Ethereum become an open, decentralized infrastructure for the world. We allocate resources to critical projects when needed and step back when others can take the lead.

Role summary
We are looking for a developer to join the Ethereum Foundation’s Account Abstraction & Interop efforts. You will focus on improving the developer experience (DX) for both ERC-4337 and EIL (Ethereum Interoperability Layer), helping developers build, test, and integrate with these protocols.
This role combines hands-on tool development with applied protocol knowledge. You’ll create and maintain frameworks, plugins, and testing environments that make it easier for developers to adopt account abstraction and cross-chain interoperability.

About the team
The Chain & Account Abstraction team works at the cutting edge of Ethereum usability, focused on:
• Account Abstraction (ERC-4337) – enabling smart contract wallets and alternative transaction flows: https://erc4337.io
• EIL (Ethereum Interoperability Layer) - connecting L1 and L2s.

Key responsibilities
Your mission is to lower the barriers to experimentation and adoption by providing powerful, user-friendly developer tools and testing environments.
Depending on your skills and interests, you will contribute to a subset of the following:
• Build and maintain Foundry, Hardhat, viem, and ethers.js plugins to support ERC-4337:
  • Local test environments
  • UserOperation (UserOp) building, encoding/decoding, and error decoding
• Develop a gas estimation toolkit:
  • Per-account and per-paymaster validation gas analysis
• Designing, implementing and supporting new integrations with external projects, protocols and developer frameworks
• For the new EIL interop protocol, design and maintain a multichain testing framework and documentation
• Document your work and collaborate closely with researchers, protocol developers, and ecosystem partners.

Required skills & experience
• Strong experience in Ethereum development tooling (Foundry, Hardhat, viem, ethers.js, or similar).
• Solid knowledge of smart contract development (Solidity, contract deployment, testing, debugging).
• Strong knowledge of TypeScript, JavaScript, Solidity, familiar with Rust, Go, Node.js, React, Angular, Swift/Kotlin can be a plus.
• Familiarity with ERC-4337 and account abstraction concepts.
• Comfort with cross-chain or multichain development.
• Past contributions to open source Ethereum projects are highly valued.
• Excellent communication skills and ability to work in a distributed, asynchronous team.
• Curiosity, initiative, and a willingness to keep learning.

Logistics
• Fully remote, full-time position.
• Flexible hours, though overlapping with Western Europe time zones is a plus (especially around “Eth o’clock” – 14:00 UTC).
• Occasional travel to Ethereum events is encouraged but not required.
